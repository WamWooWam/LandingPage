This is a small website written with Preact that tells people who I am, and provides links to my social media/projects, as well as acting as a host for any webtoys I make. There should be a live version available at [https://wamwoowam.co.uk](https://wamwoowam.co.uk).

It pulls data from YouTube, GitHub, Twitch and [snug.moe](https://snug.moe/@wamwoowam) to provide realtime feeds of information, and provides an environment for webtoys and games complete with full split-screen multitasking in the style of Windows 8.1's Metro UI.
